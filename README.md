# Language Translator using Watson API

IBM Watsonâ„¢ Language Translator allows you to translate text programmatically from one language into another language. Here in this project I have created two translators.

One of the translator converts between English, Spanish, German and French. While the other translator converts text in English language to Various Indian Languages. There are few prerequisites before you can use the translators.

# Language Translator

This translator coverts text between English, Spanish, German and French. Once the user runs the code, he/she will be asked to enter a language they want to translate from. Next they will be asked to, enter the language to which they want to convert. Then the user will be asked to enter his text and as soon as he runs, output in the desired language will be obtained.

The user can switch between any four languages mentioned above. If any other language is entered, the program will ask to check the input and enter the details again.

# English to Indian Language Translator

This translator coverts text from English to Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu. Here the user only have to enter the output language as the input is taken only in English. 

The user can change only the output language as the input language is fixed. If any language other than the mentioned above is entered, the program will ask the user to check the input and enter the details again.
